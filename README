This is my unix shell for project 1.  The program is compiled by typing "make" into the command line and hitting enter.  
After compiling, type ./myshell to start the program.
In order to take command line input from the shell, start the program and then type your commands. 
If you would like to input a file containing commands, you may do one of the following:
1. Compile and then type "./myshell filename", where filename is the name of your file containing commands.  
2. Compile and run ./myshell. Once the program is running, type "myshell filename", where the filename is the name of your file containing commands.
In both cases, the shell will run the commands and then terminate the program.
Enjoy!
